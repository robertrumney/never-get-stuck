# never-get-stuck
A Unity script to prevent player characters from getting stuck in the environment. The script checks the player's velocity and input, and moves the player slightly in a random direction if they are deemed to be stuck. This helps to ensure that the player is able to move freely and avoid getting stuck in corners or other tight spaces
